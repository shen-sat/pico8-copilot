Aims:
- store player animations in an object: player_animations

- create a new object called next_animation_manager
- pass the responsibility of next_frame to next_animation_manager
- next_animation_manager will have only one input: animation
- using that animation, and using global state, it will detrmine the next animations to play (if any)
